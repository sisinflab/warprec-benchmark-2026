######################

The **Collaborative-Filtering Recommenders** module of WarpRec is a collection of collaborative models.
In the following sections you will find the list of available models within WarpRec, together with their respective parameters.
These models can be used as-is or customized to fit experimental needs.

=============
Autoencoders
=============

Autoencoder models learn compact latent representations of users or items by reconstructing user-item interaction data.
These models are particularly effective in sparse recommendation settings.

- EASE (Embarrassingly Shallow Autoencoder):
  A simple, closed-form linear model that uses ridge regression to learn item-item similarities. Highly efficient and effective as a collaborative filtering baseline.
