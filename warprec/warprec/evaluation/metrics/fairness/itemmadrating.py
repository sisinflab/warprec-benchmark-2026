class ItemMADRating(TopKMetric):
    """Item MAD Rating (ItemMADRating) metric.

    This metric measures the disparity in the average rating received by items
    across different item clusters, considering only the items that were recommended
    and were relevant to the user. It computes the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
    of the average rating per item cluster. The goal is to evaluate whether some item
    clusters receive consistently higher or lower average ratings when they are
    successfully recommended (i.e., recommended to a relevant user).

    Formally, the metric is defined as:

        MAD = mean_{c_1, c_2} (|mean_avg_rating(c_1) - mean_avg_rating(c_2)|)

    where:
        - mean_avg_rating(c) is the average of the per-item average ratings for all
          items in cluster c that were recommended and relevant at least once.
        - The per-item average rating is the sum of ratings an item received when
          recommended to a relevant user, divided by the count of times it was
          recommended to a relevant user.

    This metric is useful to detect disparities in the quality (in terms of received
    rating/relevance) of recommended items across clusters (e.g., genres, popularity buckets),
    specifically focusing on items that were relevant and successfully recommended.

    The metric tracks the sum of ratings and the count of recommendations for relevant items only
    for each item. These per-item statistics are then aggregated by cluster to compute
    cluster-level means of these average item ratings, and their deviation is computed.

    For further details on the concept, please refer to this `link <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3269206.3271795>`_.
