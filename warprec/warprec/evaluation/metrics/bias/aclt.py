class ACLT(UserAverageTopKMetric):
    """ACLT (Average Coverage of Long-Tail items) is a metric that evaluates the
    extent to which a recommendation system provides recommendations from the long-tail
    of item popularity. The long-tail is determined based on a given popularity percentile threshold.

    This metric is designed to assess recommendation diversity by measuring the
    proportion of recommended long-tail items relative to all recommendations. A higher
    ACLT value indicates a system that effectively recommends less popular items.

    The metric formula is defined as:
        ACLT = sum(long_hits) / users

    where:
        -long_hits are the number of recommendation in the long tail.

    Matrix computation of the metric:
        PREDS                   TARGETS
    +---+---+---+---+       +---+---+---+---+
    | 8 | 2 | 7 | 2 |       | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
    | 5 | 4 | 3 | 9 |       | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
    +---+---+---+---+       +---+---+---+---+

    We extract the top-k predictions and get their column index. Let's assume k=2:
      TOP-K
    +---+---+
    | 0 | 2 |
    | 3 | 0 |
    +---+---+

    then we extract the relevance (original score) for that user in that column but maintaining the original dimensions:
           REL
    +---+---+---+---+
    | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
    | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
    +---+---+---+---+

    Then we finally extract the long tail items from the relevance matrix.
    Check BaseMetric for more details on the long tail definition.
