class Recall(UserAverageTopKMetric):
    r"""The Recall@k counts the number of item retrieve correctly,
        over the total number of relevant item in the ground truth.

    The metric formula is defined as:
        Recall@k = (1 / |U_valid|) * sum_{u \in U_valid} (|Rel_u \cap Rec_{u,k}| / |Rel_u|)

    where:
        - $U_{valid}$ is the set of users with at least one relevant item in the ground truth.
        - $Rel_u$ is the set of items relevant to user $u$.
        - $Rec_{u,k}$ is the set of top-k recommended items for user $u$.
        - $| \cdot |$ denotes the cardinality of a set.

    Matrix computation of the metric:
        PREDS                   TARGETS
    +---+---+---+---+       +---+---+---+---+
    | 8 | 2 | 7 | 2 |       | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
    | 5 | 4 | 3 | 9 |       | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
    +---+---+---+---+       +---+---+---+---+

    We extract the top-k predictions and get their column index. Let's assume k=2:
      TOP-K
    +---+---+
    | 0 | 2 |
    | 3 | 0 |
    +---+---+

    then we extract the relevance (original score) for that user in that column:
       REL
    +---+---+
    | 0 | 1 |
    | 1 | 0 |
    +---+---+

    Recall@2 = [(1 / 2) + (1 / 2)] / 2 = 0.5
